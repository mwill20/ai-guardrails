# 🧗‍♂️ Python Guardrail Mastery Ladder — Updated Training Plan  
Lightweight, Progressive, Transferable  
For Deterministic → Semantic → Hybrid Guardrail Development

---

This is the **training architecture** you'll use across all phases and all guardrail projects.  
Each stage requires **3 clean reps** to advance.

---

# 1️⃣ PYRAMID TRAINING — Full Pipeline Reconstruction (3× Full Runs)

Progressively rebuild the entire guardrail pipeline in layers:

1. **Imports only**  
2. **Type definitions**  
3. **Function signatures**  
4. **Classification logic** (deterministic + semantic + combine)  
5. **Sanitization + Logging**  
6. **Full pipeline wiring** (`process_input`)  
7. **Test harness** (`if __name__ == "__main__": ...`)

A **full pyramid run** = completing all seven layers.  
Do **3 full runs** before moving on.

---

# 2️⃣ ROUND 1 — Progressive Prompts (3×)

I give increasingly detailed tasks (e.g., “write function X,” “add rule Y”).  
You implement them correctly.

Reinforces incremental, guided construction.

---

# 3️⃣ ROUND 2 — Fill-in-the-Missing Parts (3×)

You receive partially written code.  
You must complete missing logic, signatures, or structures.

Reinforces pattern recognition and structural understanding.

---

# 4️⃣ ROUND 3 — Broken Code Repair (3×)

You receive intentionally broken guardrail code:
- wrong imports  
- incorrect logic  
- misordered arguments  
- syntax issues  

You debug and fix it.

Reinforces error detection and debugging instinct.

---

# 5️⃣ ROUND 4 — Blind Rewrite Challenges (3×)

Rewrite sections or the entire pipeline **from memory**.  
No looking. No hints.

Reinforces recall, structure, and long-term fluency.

---

# 6️⃣ ROUND 5 — Timed Rep Sets (3×)

Rebuild key components or the entire guardrail pipeline under time limits:  
10 minutes → 7 minutes → 5 minutes.

Reinforces speed, clarity, and execution confidence.

---

# 7️⃣ ROUND 6 — “Break Everything I Think I Know” (Generalization Phase) (3×)

Apply the same architecture to **completely new guardrail systems**, e.g.:

- PII leakage guardrails  
- Tool-use guardrails  
- Data exfiltration guardrails  
- API rate-limiting guardrails  
- New risk label sets  
- New data structures  
- New logic pathways  

For each new system:
1. Define the **pipeline shape**  
2. Define types / literals / data containers  
3. Define function boundaries  
4. Implement core logic (even simplified)  

Do this **3 times with 3 different systems**.

This builds **transferable skill**, not memorization.

---

# 🎯 PROGRESSION RULE  
Each stage requires **3 correct reps** before progression.  
No skipping. No shortcuts.  
Mastery is built through repetition + variation.

---

# ⭐ SUCCESS OUTCOME  
By completing:

- **3 Pyramid cycles**  
- **Rounds 1–6 (3× each)**  

You gain:

- structural fluency  
- reconstruction ability  
- debugging instinct  
- adaptability to new specifications  
- real readiness for AI Security engineering tasks  

You will be able to design, rebuild, and adapt guardrail systems from scratch —  
even under interview pressure or unfamiliar requirements.
